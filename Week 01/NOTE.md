# 学习笔记

- Learnt basic JS, CSS and HTML (I'd rarely written any raw html/js code. Usually I start with some framework like React. Thus I'm not familiar with HTML/Dom APIs.)
- Learnt to think differently when resolving game AI problems. Also a little deep dive into recursions.
- Learnt history of `yield`, `Promise` and `async/await`.
- Learnt some good tips when writing js code. (But I prefer typescript.)
